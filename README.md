# CIFAR-10-Image-Recognition

## Description
A comprehensive deep learning project for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using state-of-the-art neural networks. This project explores various deep learning techniques and architectures to achieve high accuracy in image classification.

## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This project aims to classify these images using deep learning techniques, primarily focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
